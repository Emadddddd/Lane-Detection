# Lane-Detection
IIOT Lab Task 1
In this report, I will be going over how to make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road by applying OpenCV functions to detect lanes in an image and later a video by following a pipeline. The following steps will be done in order to obtain the result : Greyscale imaging, Noise filtering, Smoothing, Region masking, Canny edge, Hough transformation, Video processing frame-by-frame and Saving the video as a mp4.
